    sweet is a <strong>utopian social network</strong>, an experiment in creating a better online world for folk who are made to feel unsafe online - all are welcome, but we especially seek to create a safer space for queer and trans people, women, disabled people, and people of colour. only by coming together we can work for the abolition of patriarchy and capitalism.

  <h5><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> sweet is built on trust.</h5>
  <p>
    on sweet, you can <strong class="text-success">trust</strong> users alongside following them. users you trust see your private posts, and in return you will see which users they have anonymously <strong class="text-danger">flagged</strong> as unsafe.
  </p>

  <h5><i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> sweet is built on privacy.</h5>
  <p>
    sweet will never have ads, never track its users, and never willingly share data with external organisations and services.
  </p>

  <h5><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> sweet is built around communities.</h5>
  <p>
    in sweet communities, there are no administrators or moderators. all members share responsibility for managing the community, and decisions like changes to the community rules or banning users are put to a majority vote before they can be enacted. communities can be made private and invite-only.
